I began programming in December 2019 when I started teaching myself the basics of Python. I completed several mini-projects and started to teach myself Jupyter Notebooks and Data Analysis with Python soon after. In October 2020, I taught myself the basics of C++ and began to solve competitive programming problems for fun. Around May 2020, I started using the Arduino development platform to complete various projects. This GitHub profile page became active in June 2021. I created directory for and upload some of my past projects in July 2021.
