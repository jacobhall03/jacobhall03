ðŸ“œ History:
I began programming in December 2019 when I started teaching myself the basics of Python. I completed several mini-projects and started to teach myself Jupyter Notebooks and Data Analysis with Python soon after. In October 2020, I taught myself the basics of C++ and began to solve competitive programming problems for fun. Around May 2020, I started using the Arduino development platform to complete various projects. I completed a course titled "AP Computer Science A" in May 2021 that was taught using Java; though no source code from the course is on this profile, I earned a 5 of 5 on the College Board final exam. This GitHub profile page became active in June 2021. I created directories for and uploaded some of my past projects in July 2021.
